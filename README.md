PhotoGram/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/          # Node.js + Express Backend
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/         # React + Vite Frontend
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PhotoGram.git
cd PhotoGram
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:

```env
PORT=5000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_token_secret
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=10d

MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

#### Start the Backend Server

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### 3. Set Up the Frontend

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```



#### Start the Frontend Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

- **cloudinary**: For uploading and managing images on the Cloudinary platform.
- **mongoose**: For interacting with MongoDB in an object-oriented way.
- **cookie-parser**: To parse and manage cookies for user authentication.
- **dotenv**: To manage environment variables securely.

### Frontend
- **axios**: For making API requests to the backend.
- **react-router-dom**: For handling client-side routing.
- **tailwindcss**: For efficient, utility-first CSS styling.

## Scripts
